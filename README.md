# Video demo
1. Make sure you have access to [Twilio Video beta](https://www.twilio.com/video).

1. Change the `window.accessToken` line in `demo.js` to the access token
   generated on the 
   [Twilio video quickstart page](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/getting-started).

1. From the base directory of this project, fire up a local HTTP server. For 
   example with Python 2 you can do this easy with this command:

        python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

1. Head to http://localhost:8000/ and check out the demo in action.

1. Work through [step-1](https://github.com/makaimc/video-demo/tree/step-1), 
   [step-2](https://github.com/makaimc/video-demo/tree/step-2) and 
   [step-3](https://github.com/makaimc/video-demo/tree/step-3) tags to 
   understand how to build up the demo.
